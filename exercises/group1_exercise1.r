Import the data file df.gr1 into R.
Describe the data as it is using descriptive statistics measures and graphics. Observe that you are not supposed to perform any statistical analysis using test etc.
• You may detect that there are missing data and suspect values. Discuss how you would like to clean the data and perform the cleaning as a preparation for a future statistical analysis.
• Weight is not in the file. Calculate it using BMI and height (hint BMI = weight/(height/100)2).
• Describe the new cleaned data in a similar way as above.
• Look at the histograms of shoesize, income, and age. How do they differ? How would you charac- terize them?
  • Is there a relationship between height and shoe size?
  • Is there a relationship between alcohol and depression
• Is there a relationship between angina, age and county? Start by looking at pairwise relationship between the variables.
• Prepare a presentation e.g. using powerpoint.
